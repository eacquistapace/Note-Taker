## Description
---
This app uses Express.js to retrieve data from a JSON file in order to create, save, and delete notes made by a user. The user is first presented with a landing page with a link to the notes page. After clicking that link, the user is then able to create their notes with a title and description. The app is deployed through Heroku, which you can find the link listed in the 'About' section of this repository.
